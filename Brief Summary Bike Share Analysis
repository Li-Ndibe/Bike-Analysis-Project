The Bike-Share Analysis Capstone Project by Google/Coursera for Google Data Analytics Course.The Data was provided from "Google Data Analytics Case Study | Kaggle".

library(ggplot2)

Python Jupiter notebook was used to merge the 12 months datasets into one year (2021).

Some metrics was used for the Analysis and visualization on Tableau public (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lindibe)
